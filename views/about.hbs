          Greetings, my name is Justin Oeters, pronounced like eight-ers, and I
          have been interested in programming and computers since my first Apple
          IIe in the 80’s. As a youth, in addition to computers, I was also a
          member of the Boy Scouts of America and a member of several sports
          teams. I graduated high school fourth in my class and have earned a
          bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree as well as attended one year
          of law school. My education invoked my thirst for knowledge and I
          strive to learn new things every day.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Regarding employment, I have had several jobs ranging from retail work
          to probation. My longest career paths have been as a customer service
          representative for Best Buy and currently, a Probation Officer for
          Butler County. Working for Best Buy, I learned about working with
          people and overcoming adversity as well as best business practices. As
          a probation officer, I learned to supervise, distribute tasks, and
          keep people motivated to stay on task. Although my employment has been
          rewarding, I am ready for greater challenges.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My experiences have taught me to be a dedicated worker and to do more
          than produce a mediocre result. I am always willing to learn new
          things and devote extra time to making a product that is not just
          good, but phenomenal. As an employee of your company, I would bring
          all my skills and knowledge to make us as successful as possible and
          further my knowledge even if it is not necessary.
